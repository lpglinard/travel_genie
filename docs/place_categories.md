# Place Categories

This document describes the implementation of place categories in the Travel Genie app.

## Overview

Each place in the app has a list of types (e.g., "restaurant", "airport", etc.). The new category feature groups these types into meaningful categories to help users better understand and filter places.

A place can belong to multiple categories, and each category can contain multiple place types.

## Implementation

### Models

The implementation consists of two main classes:

1. `PlaceCategory`: Represents a category of places with properties for:
   - ID
   - Name
   - List of place types
   - Icon
   - Light and dark colors
   - Description

2. `PlaceCategories`: A utility class with:
   - Static instances of all 9 categories
   - Methods to get categories for a place
   - Method to get a category by ID

### Categories

## Usage

### Getting Categories for a Place

```dart
// Get a place from somewhere
Place place = ...;

// Get all categories that this place belongs to
List<PlaceCategory> categories = PlaceCategories.getCategoriesForPlace(place);

// Use the categories
for (final category in categories) {
  print('${place.displayName} belongs to ${category.name}');
  // Use category.icon, category.lightColor, etc.
}
```

### Getting a Category by ID

```dart
// Get a category by its ID
PlaceCategory? category = PlaceCategories.getCategoryById(1);
if (category != null) {
  print('Category: ${category.name}');
}
```

### Checking if a Place Belongs to a Category

```dart
// Check if a place belongs to a specific category
Place place = ...;
bool isTransportation = PlaceCategories.transportation.containsPlace(place);
if (isTransportation) {
  print('${place.displayName} is a transportation place');
}
```

## UI Integration Examples

### Displaying Category Icons and Colors

```dart
// In a widget
Widget buildCategoryIcon(PlaceCategory category) {
  return Icon(
    category.icon,
    color: Theme.of(context).brightness == Brightness.light
        ? category.lightColor
        : category.darkColor,
  );
}
```

### Filtering Places by Category

```dart
// Get all places
List<Place> allPlaces = ...;

// Filter places by a specific category
List<Place> transportationPlaces = allPlaces
    .where((place) => PlaceCategories.transportation.containsPlace(place))
    .toList();
```

### Grouping Places by Category

```dart
// Get all places
List<Place> allPlaces = ...;

// Group places by category
Map<PlaceCategory, List<Place>> placesByCategory = {};

for (final category in PlaceCategories.all) {
  placesByCategory[category] = allPlaces
      .where((place) => category.containsPlace(place))
      .toList();
}

// Use the grouped places
for (final entry in placesByCategory.entries) {
  print('Category: ${entry.key.name}, Places: ${entry.value.length}');
}
```

## Next Steps

The category structure can be used to:

1. Filter places by category in search results
2. Display category icons and colors in the UI
3. Group places by category in lists or maps
4. Provide category-specific recommendations
